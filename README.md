# Analysing-Investment

### Business Problem Overview
An asset management firm is looking to invest in a select few businesses. In order to make wise investment selections, the CEO is interested in learning about the worldwide trends in investing.

### Business Goals
The asset management firm wants to invest where most other investors are investing.

The asset management firm wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

The asset management firm wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.

### Steps followed to perform the investment analysis
1. **Data Processing:** I have combined the datasets and addressed any missing values to ensure a comprehensive and accurate analysis.
2. **Funding Type Analysis:** I then evaluated and compared typical investment amounts across various funding types, including venture, seed, angel, and private equity, to determine the most suitable option for Spark Funds' strategy.
3. **Country Analysis:** I later identified the countries that have received the highest investment levels historically, helping Spark Funds to pinpoint their preferred investment destinations.
4. **Sector Analysis:** Finally, I analyzed the distribution of investments across the eight primary sectors to gain insights into market trends and opportunities.
